Interaction between two households, with knowledge transfer through social learning

The simulation involves hypothetical artificial household member agents engaging in collective action and inter-network social learning. Specifically, the example shows household member agents from two households over a period of 10 years selecting from their agent-specific sets of employment decision options and learning from each other about available employment opportunities.

The example demonstrates the coevolution of mental models through a complex relationship among factors influencing decision-making, which, in this case, included access to knowledge and personal- and household-level constraints. Recognizing and analyzing these complex relationships has the potential of improving our understanding of context-specific social change and, in turn, our ability to plan proactive adaptation to changes in the climate.
